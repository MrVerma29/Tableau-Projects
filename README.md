# IMDb Movie Rating Analysis
Description: The IMDb Movie Rating Analysis project involved a deep dive into the world of cinema, focusing on understanding and analyzing movie ratings data from IMDb (Internet Movie Database). Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), I uncovered underlying patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset. Leveraging Python and R programming languages, I implemented data preprocessing techniques, including one-hot encoding for categorical variables and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. Visualizations created in Tableau provided intuitive representations of the analysis findings, offering valuable insights for filmmakers, studios, and movie enthusiasts alike.

# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis
Description: The Telecom Customer Churn Analysis project aimed to understand and mitigate customer churn within a telecom company. Leveraging a sample dataset containing customer demographics, usage patterns, and churn status, I conducted exploratory data analysis to identify factors influencing churn rates. Designing and developing a dashboard in Tableau, I visualized churn distribution across customer segments and key performance metrics. The interactive dashboard provided stakeholders with actionable insights to devise targeted retention strategies, enhance customer engagement, and reduce churn rates effectively.
